# Executive UI Authority Rules

## 1. What Gets Visual Dominance

1. Decision consequences and quantified business impact
2. Intervention requirements with time pressure
3. Termination triggers with irreversibility warnings
4. Resource reallocation trade-offs with opportunity costs
5. Failure inevitability timelines with consequence curves

## 2. What Must Be Visually Subdued

1. Technical implementation details
2. Historical performance metrics
3. Process compliance indicators
4. Individual contributor activity
5. System status confirmations

## 3. Rules for Using Emphasis

Emphasis is allowed only when it serves decision consequence hierarchy. Size, weight, or contrast may be increased only for elements that:
- Quantify business value at risk
- Establish intervention deadlines
- Signal irreversible failure points
- Compare mutually exclusive decision paths
- Highlight resource allocation conflicts

Emphasis must never be used for:
- Visual appeal or aesthetic enhancement
- Information organization or navigation
- Status communication or confirmation
- Process facilitation or user comfort
- Branding or institutional signaling

## 4. Rules for Using Color

Color is forbidden except when it signals decision consequences:
- Red is allowed only for failure states with quantified business damage
- Blue is allowed only for intervention pathways with resource requirements
- Green is allowed only for continuation decisions with sustained value delivery
- Gray is allowed only for neutral information that does not affect decision outcomes

Color is explicitly forbidden for:
- Navigation or interaction feedback
- Status communication or system health
- Information hierarchy or content organization
- Visual breathing room or layout enhancement
- Emotional comfort or user engagement

## 5. Rules for Motion & Interactivity

Motion is forbidden. All elements must remain static and inevitable.

Interactivity is allowed only for decision commitment:
- Clicking is permitted only when it commits to a verdict (Continue/Intervene/Terminate)
- Hover states are permitted only when they reveal decision consequences
- Selection is permitted only when it chooses between mutually exclusive paths

Interactivity is forbidden for:
- Information exploration or detail drilling
- Process navigation or workflow progression
- Status checking or confirmation seeking
- Content organization or preference setting
- System interaction or user comfort

## 6. What Would Immediately Break Executive Trust

- Animations that suggest playfulness or approachability
- Bright colors that imply optimism or enthusiasm
- Rounded corners that soften decision edges
- Icons that decorate rather than signal consequences
- Gradients that create visual comfort instead of tension
- Whitespace that creates breathing room instead of decision pressure
- Shadows that suggest depth instead of finality
- Typography that feels contemporary instead of institutional
- Layouts that prioritize scannability over consequence
- Interactions that feel responsive instead of authoritative
