# Rock Evidence Strategy

## 1. Evidence Principles

1. Evidence must prove or disprove initiative viability under current conditions.
2. Evidence must quantify business impact, not technical progress.
3. Evidence must compare actual trajectory against success requirements.
4. Evidence must reveal whether gaps are correctable within resource constraints.
5. Evidence must force a verdict: Continue, Intervene, or Terminate.

## 2. Allowed Evidence Types

- **Value Delivery Gap**: Quantified difference between current delivery rate and required success criteria, expressed as time delay and cost overrun impact
- **Recovery Cost Estimate**: Dollar amount and time required to restore initiative to viable trajectory, with confidence ranges
- **Dependency Failure Risk**: Probability-weighted impact of external factors beyond initiative control, with mitigation cost estimates
- **Leadership Effectiveness Delta**: Comparative performance metrics against proven program leaders, with quantified gap in delivery velocity
- **Resource Efficiency Ratio**: Current spending velocity against industry benchmarks for similar initiatives, highlighting waste or shortfall
- **Stakeholder Commitment Level**: Explicit commitment status from key partners, customers, and internal sponsors with breach consequences
- **Market Window Closure**: Time remaining before competitive or market conditions eliminate the opportunity entirely

## 3. Banned Evidence Types

- Raw performance metrics without business context
- Historical trend charts showing past performance
- Technical implementation status or code completion rates
- Individual task completion or activity logs
- Budget utilization percentages without outcome correlation
- Team satisfaction surveys or morale indicators
- Meeting attendance or communication frequency metrics
- Status updates that don't connect to business success criteria
- False comfort indicators that mask fundamental problems
- Information requiring technical expertise to interpret

## 4. How Evidence Supports Each Verdict

### Continue As-Is
- Value Delivery Gap shows initiative is on track to meet success criteria
- Recovery Cost Estimate indicates no intervention needed
- Leadership Effectiveness Delta demonstrates proven capability
- Resource Efficiency Ratio confirms optimal spending velocity
- Stakeholder Commitment Level shows strong, stable support

### Intervene & Correct
- Value Delivery Gap reveals correctable shortfall with quantified impact
- Recovery Cost Estimate shows feasible correction within budget/time limits
- Dependency Failure Risk identifies specific mitigations available
- Leadership Effectiveness Delta highlights targeted capability gaps
- Market Window Closure provides time buffer for corrective action

### Terminate / De-scope
- Value Delivery Gap proves uncorrectable fundamental shortfall
- Recovery Cost Estimate exceeds business case justification
- Dependency Failure Risk shows catastrophic external factors
- Resource Efficiency Ratio indicates systemic waste beyond correction
- Market Window Closure shows opportunity permanently lost

## 5. If We Could Show ONLY 3 Visuals

1. **Value Delivery Trajectory**: Current progress line against required success threshold, showing whether gap is closing or widening over time
2. **Recovery Cost Boundary**: Range of intervention costs and timeframes, with clear demarcation of what's economically justifiable
3. **Failure Consequence Timeline**: Projected impact timeline if no action taken, showing when business damage becomes irreversible

These three visuals are sufficient because they directly answer the core executive question: "Can this still succeed, and what must change now?" The trajectory proves current reality, the cost boundary defines intervention feasibility, and the consequence timeline creates decision urgency.
