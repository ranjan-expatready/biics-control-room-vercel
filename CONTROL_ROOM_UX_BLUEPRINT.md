# Control Room UX Blueprint

## 1. The One Thing This Page Must Make Obvious

This program will fail in specific ways within 30-60 days unless leadership intervenes immediately.

## 2. Primary Executive Question This Page Answers

Where will this program fail in the next 30-60 days unless I personally intervene - and what decision do I need to make right now?

## 3. Page Zones (Top → Bottom)

### Zone 1: Critical Intervention Alerts (Top Priority)
**Purpose:** Force immediate awareness of existential threats requiring C-suite attention
**What it shows:** The 3 most urgent failure points across the entire portfolio, ranked by potential business impact and time to crisis
**What decision pressure it creates:** "These will fail unless I act this week - what resources do I redirect?"

### Zone 2: Decision Command Center (Actionable Interventions)
**Purpose:** Present the specific decisions leadership must make in the next 7 days
**What it shows:** Three prioritized decision categories with concrete options and quantified business impact
**What decision pressure it creates:** "I must choose from these options - delay means accepting the quantified losses"

### Zone 3: Program Health Overview (Contextual Status)
**Purpose:** Provide high-level portfolio condition without overwhelming detail
**What it shows:** Aggregate health across all initiatives with trend direction and confidence level
**What decision pressure it creates:** "The overall program is at risk - I need to focus on the critical interventions above"

### Zone 4: Resource Allocation Map (Opportunity Cost)
**Purpose:** Show where investments are currently committed and highlight reallocation opportunities
**What it shows:** Current resource distribution across initiatives with over/under-allocation indicators
**What decision pressure it creates:** "Resources are inefficiently deployed - where do I redirect investment?"

### Zone 5: Forward-Looking Indicators (Prevention Focus)
**Purpose:** Highlight initiatives that could become problems before they require crisis intervention
**What it shows:** Early warning signals for initiatives trending toward failure with time remaining to intervene
**What decision pressure it creates:** "These aren't critical yet, but I should monitor them for next week's decisions"
