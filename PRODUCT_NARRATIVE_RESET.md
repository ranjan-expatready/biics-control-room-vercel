# Product Narrative Reset: BIICS

## 1. What This Product Is Trying To Be

A "Program Balanced Scorecard OS" that gives executives "decision-grade visibility" across "Big Rocks" to "accelerate decisions and eliminate surprises." It claims to be a "governance operating system" with "real-time portfolio health, risk, and performance tracking" that provides "executive-grade UX design" matching "Big-5 consulting firm deliverables."

## 2. What Executives Actually Need In This Situation

Executives need to know: "What must I personally decide this week to keep the company on track?" They don't need another dashboard showing them what they already know is broken. They need:

- **Clear escalation paths** for decisions that are stuck
- **Predictive indicators** of which initiatives will miss their targets
- **Resource conflict resolution** when multiple priorities compete
- **Risk mitigation prioritization** that connects to business outcomes
- **Succession planning** for initiatives that are failing

Executives are drowning in status reports. They need a system that tells them what they DON'T know yet, and what they must DO about it.

## 3. Where The Current Product Misses

The product presents itself as a "balanced scorecard" but delivers a basic status dashboard. Key failures:

### Data Quality Issues
- KPI achievement rates are unrealistically high (99.8% uptime targets)
- No clear connection between metrics and business impact
- Demo data looks like placeholder numbers, not real business signals

### Decision Framework Absence
- Shows "pending decisions" but no escalation logic
- No clear ownership of who must decide what by when
- Missing: "This decision is 12 days overdue and blocks $2.3M in revenue"

### Executive Context Missing
- 68% portfolio health score means nothing without business context
- No translation of technical metrics to business outcomes
- Lacks: "This represents $8.2M at risk across 3 initiatives"

### Governance Model Incomplete
- Shows meeting cadences but no decision velocity metrics
- No visibility into approval bottlenecks
- Missing: "Governance cycle time increased 40% this quarter"

## 4. The One-Sentence Product Promise (Board-Grade)

"BIICS tells executives exactly which decisions they must make this week to prevent $10M+ in portfolio failures, with real-time visibility into what's working, what's broken, and what requires their immediate intervention."

## 5. The 3 Decisions This Product Must Enable — Or It Has Failed

### Decision 1: Resource Reallocation
**When executives see:** "Initiative A is 85% likely to fail and Initiative B has excess capacity"
**They must decide:** "Should we reallocate $500K from Initiative A to Initiative B?"
**Success metric:** System shows resource conflict opportunities with quantified business impact

### Decision 2: Risk Escalation Priority
**When executives see:** "Critical risk: 'Data Center Migration' has 90% probability and $12M impact"
**They must decide:** "Do we pause the migration or allocate emergency budget?"
**Success metric:** Risks ranked by business impact, not just technical severity

### Decision 3: Initiative Termination
**When executives see:** "Initiative C has 15% health score and zero recovery likelihood"
**They must decide:** "Do we kill this initiative and reallocate resources to higher-value work?"
**Success metric:** Clear failure prediction with alternative investment recommendations
