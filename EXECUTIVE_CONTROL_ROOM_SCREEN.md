# Executive Control Room Screen

## 1. The One Question This Screen Answers

What must I decide this week to protect value, prevent failure, and redirect investment before it is too late?

## 2. What the Executive Sees in the First 10 Seconds

- Three failing initiatives demanding immediate intervention
- Two additional initiatives at critical risk thresholds
- Quantified value destruction timelines showing when each failure becomes irreversible
- Explicit executive ownership assignments with decision deadlines
- Seven acceptable initiatives providing context without distraction

## 3. Screen Zones (Top → Bottom)

### Zone 1: Executive Intervention Required
- **Purpose**: Establishes the decision imperative by showing initiatives that will fail without immediate action
- **Visual Primitive**: Threshold boundaries showing where current trajectories cross into unacceptable performance
- **Decision Forced**: Whether to intervene now or accept terminal failure for each initiative

### Zone 2: Decisions Required This Week
- **Purpose**: Lists specific decisions with quantified consequences and explicit ownership
- **Visual Primitive**: Value exposure blocks showing financial, temporal, and strategic damage from delay
- **Decision Forced**: Which decisions to make immediately, delegate, or escalate based on value at risk

### Zone 3: Portfolio Exposure Snapshot
- **Purpose**: Shows current state of all 12 initiatives without allowing false comfort
- **Visual Primitive**: Dependency failure chains demonstrating how local failures trigger broader portfolio collapse
- **Decision Forced**: Which acceptable initiatives to double down on versus which at-risk ones to stop

### Zone 4: Capital & Leadership Allocation
- **Purpose**: Reveals resource constraints and leadership capacity limits
- **Visual Primitive**: Recovery cost envelopes showing best-case and worst-case intervention investment ranges
- **Decision Forced**: Where to redirect capital and leadership attention from failing initiatives

### Zone 5: Failure Signals (Next 30–60 Days)
- **Purpose**: Shows impending portfolio failure points that require preemptive action
- **Visual Primitive**: Consequence timelines indicating when delay eliminates all recovery options
- **Decision Forced**: Which initiatives to terminate decisively before they consume resources irreversibly

## 4. What Forces Action on This Screen

The screen forces action through quantified consequence pressure - every element shows specific value destruction timelines and resource consumption costs. Decision ownership is explicit with named executives and deadlines, creating personal accountability. The asymmetry of 3 failing, 2 warning, and 7 acceptable initiatives creates visual imbalance that demands reallocation. Threshold boundaries eliminate gradual improvement narratives, forcing binary choices between intervention and termination.

## 5. What Is Intentionally Absent

- Overall portfolio health scores that could suggest gradual improvement
- Progress indicators implying completion without value correlation
- Trend lines suggesting predictable recovery trajectories
- Status distributions that enable optimization without termination decisions
- Historical performance data that could delay current decisions
- Interactive exploration that allows deferral through deeper analysis
- Success metrics that create false comfort about acceptable initiatives
- Decorative elements that dilute decision pressure
