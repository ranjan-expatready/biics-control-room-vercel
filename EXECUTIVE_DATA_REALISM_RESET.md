# Executive Data Realism Reset

## 1. What Real Executive Data Feels Like

1. Asymmetrical - success concentrated in few areas, failure distributed across many
2. Costly - every decision carries visible financial, temporal, and reputational weight
3. Interconnected - one failure creates cascading consequences across dependent initiatives
4. Time-sensitive - opportunities close irreversibly while decisions are debated
5. Personally consequential - leadership reputations rise or fall based on these calls

## 2. What Makes Demo Data Immediately Fake

1. Symmetrical distributions - equal success/failure ratios suggest artificial balance
2. Zero-sum comfort - all paths appear viable with no forced trade-offs
3. Isolated consequences - failures contained without ripple effects to other initiatives
4. Timeless validity - no urgency or deadline pressure forcing immediate action
5. Risk-free decisions - no personal or organizational stakes attached to outcomes

## 3. Minimum Viable Discomfort

The data must make executives physically uncomfortable - forcing them to confront that some initiatives they personally championed are failing, that resources they allocated are being wasted, and that delay amplifies damage. Without this discomfort, the data feels like a status report, not a decision-forcing mechanism.

## 4. How Many Things Should Be Failing at Once

3 of 12 initiatives must show clear failure trajectories, while 2 of 12 must show recoverable warning signs, leaving 7 of 12 in various states of acceptable progress. This creates decision pressure without overwhelming paralysis.

## 5. What Loss Must Be Visible

1. Financial - committed capital burning without corresponding progress acceleration
2. Temporal - market windows closing while governance debates continue
3. Reputational - leadership credibility eroding as stakeholders demand accountability
4. Opportunity - competitor advantage widening while resources remain locked in failing efforts
5. Strategic - core business objectives drifting while tactical initiatives consume attention

## 6. Signals That Precede Failure

- Leadership team changes accelerating without corresponding strategy shifts
- External dependencies becoming more fragile while internal timelines extend
- Customer or partner feedback turning from supportive to conditional
- Budget overruns accepted as normal rather than emergency signals
- Meeting frequency increasing while decision velocity decreasing
- Stakeholder communication becoming defensive rather than proactive
- Internal champions becoming silent while critics grow vocal
