# Rock Drill-Down UX Blueprint

## 1. The One Question This Page Must Answer

Can this initiative still succeed — and what must change now for that to happen?

## 2. Executive Verdict Options

### Continue As-Is
**Evidence:** The initiative demonstrates consistent progress toward critical milestones, leadership team is stable and experienced, funding runway extends beyond completion date, and no external dependencies are at risk. The business case remains valid with current scope and timeline.

### Intervene & Correct
**Evidence:** The initiative shows recoverable gaps in execution, leadership, or resources, but the core business value proposition remains intact. Specific corrective actions can restore momentum within 30-60 days. The underlying market opportunity or strategic need still justifies continuation.

### Terminate / De-scope
**Evidence:** The initiative has fundamental flaws in business case, execution capability, or market conditions that cannot be corrected within reasonable time/cost constraints. Leadership changes or resource increases cannot salvage the value proposition. Opportunity costs of continuation exceed potential benefits.

## 3. Page Zones (Top → Bottom)

### Zone 1: Verdict Overview (Executive Summary)
**Purpose:** Establish immediate clarity on the initiative's current trajectory
**What it proves:** Whether this initiative is on track to deliver promised value or requires intervention
**What decision it informs:** Whether to continue monitoring, intervene immediately, or terminate

### Zone 2: Leadership & Execution Assessment
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether the right people and processes are in place to succeed
**What it proves:** If leadership capability, team stability, and execution discipline support success
**What decision it informs:** Whether leadership changes or process interventions are required

### Zone 3: Value Proposition Validation
**Purpose:** Confirm whether the initiative still delivers strategic or financial value worth pursuing
**What it proves:** If market conditions, competitive landscape, and business case remain valid
**What decision it informs:** Whether the strategic rationale still justifies continued investment

### Zone 4: Resource & Dependency Analysis
**Purpose:** Assess whether adequate resources and external support are available
**What it proves:** If funding, talent, technology, and partner commitments enable success
**What decision it informs:** Whether resource reallocation or dependency mitigation is needed

### Zone 5: Recovery Action Plan
**Purpose:** Present concrete steps to restore initiative health if intervention is chosen
**What it proves:** Specific, time-bound actions that can turn around failing initiatives
**What decision it informs:** Whether corrective actions are feasible and worth the investment

## 4. Evidence That This Rock Will Fail If Nothing Changes

- Leadership team has changed three times in six months, creating continuity gaps
- Critical external dependencies (partners, regulatory approvals, technology platforms) are delayed or uncertain
- Market conditions have shifted, reducing the original business case value by more than 40%
- Key customers or stakeholders have withdrawn support or signaled dissatisfaction
- Budget overruns exceed 50% with no corresponding progress acceleration
- Competing initiatives are delivering superior results with fewer resources
- Original success criteria have been repeatedly redefined downward

## 5. What Must Change In The Next 30 Days For This Rock To Succeed

- Replace or reinforce the initiative leader with proven program management experience
- Secure explicit commitments from critical external partners with enforceable SLAs
- Reduce scope by 30-50% to focus on highest-value deliverables only
- Reallocate $500K-$2M in additional funding from lower-priority initiatives
- Establish weekly executive oversight meetings with escalation triggers
- Replace 2-3 key team members with specialized expertise in blocking areas
- Renegotiate with primary customers to reset expectations and timelines

## 6. What This Page Must NEVER Show

- Raw performance metrics or KPI dashboards
- Historical trend charts or progress visualizations
- Technical implementation details or system architecture
- Individual task completion rates or activity logs
- Detailed budget breakdowns or financial statements
- Meeting notes or action item lists
- Team member names or organizational charts
- Status updates that don't connect to business outcomes
- False comfort indicators that mask fundamental problems
- Information that doesn't directly support the three verdict options
