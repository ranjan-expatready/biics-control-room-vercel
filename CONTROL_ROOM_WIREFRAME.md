# Control Room Wireframe

## 1. Screen Purpose

To force executives to identify which decisions must be made this week to protect value, prevent failure, and redirect investment before it is too late.

## 2. Top-Level Layout

The screen divides vertically into five decision zones stacked from top to bottom, with negative space isolating the top zone and progressive spacing compression toward the bottom to create visual momentum toward action.

## 3. Zone-by-Zone Breakdown

### Zone 1: Executive Intervention Required
- **Content**: Three initiatives past recovery thresholds with value at risk amounts and days until irreversibility
- **Visual Weight**: High - largest text, maximum spacing, isolated positioning
- **Drill-Down**: Allowed - to examine specific failure trajectories

### Zone 2: Decisions Required This Week
- **Content**: Pending decisions with assigned executives, value at risk, and decision deadlines
- **Visual Weight**: High - prominent ownership names, deadline emphasis, central positioning
- **Drill-Down**: Allowed - to access decision evidence and escalation options

### Zone 3: Systemic Exposure & Cascading Failure
- **Content**: Twelve initiative overview showing failure distribution and dependency relationships
- **Visual Weight**: Medium - balanced spacing, relationship indicators, supporting context
- **Drill-Down**: Allowed - to examine individual initiative trajectories

### Zone 4: Capital & Leadership Allocation
- **Content**: Resource requirements for intervention options and leadership capacity constraints
- **Visual Weight**: Medium - investment ranges, capacity indicators, allocation guidance
- **Drill-Down**: Not allowed - allocation decisions made at this level

### Zone 5: Failure Signals (Next 30–60 Days)
- **Content**: Timeline markers showing when additional failures become irreversible
- **Visual Weight**: Low - compressed spacing, timeline focus, consequence emphasis
- **Drill-Down**: Not allowed - signals exist to create urgency, not exploration

## 4. What Is Clickable and Why

- Initiative names in Zones 1 and 3 - to drill down into specific failure evidence and determine intervention requirements
- Decision items in Zone 2 - to access detailed evidence and escalation workflows for assigned executives
- Value at risk amounts - to reveal cost breakdowns and business impact calculations
- Timeline markers in Zone 5 - to show specific consequence progression and deadline calculations

## 5. What Is Static and Why

- Overall failure distribution counts - to provide asymmetric context without allowing optimization exploration
- Leadership capacity indicators - to show constraints without interactive resource allocation
- Dependency relationship indicators - to show systemic connections without enabling relationship browsing
- Historical performance data - to maintain focus on current decisions without trend analysis
- Acceptable initiative summaries - to provide contrast without detailed examination capabilities
