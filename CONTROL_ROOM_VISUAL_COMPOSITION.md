# Control Room Visual Composition

## 1. Visual Mood of the Screen

- Inevitable
- Authoritative
- Consequential
- Focused
- Uncomfortable

## 2. Where the Eye Goes First, Second, Third

1. **First**: The three initiatives already past recovery thresholds, positioned at the top with maximum visual weight and negative space isolation
2. **Second**: The two warning initiatives showing approaching thresholds, positioned below with secondary emphasis through scale and spacing
3. **Third**: The decisions requiring immediate executive action, positioned centrally with explicit ownership markers and deadline emphasis

## 3. How Color Is Used

Color appears only on elements representing active failure or imminent consequence, never on acceptable performance. Red signals irreversible damage approaching within 30 days, blue signals leadership intervention required immediately, and neutral tones provide context without emphasis. Color is absent from acceptable initiatives, historical data, and summary information to prevent false comfort or exploration.

## 4. How Icons Are Used

Icons signal consequence severity and appear only at decision pressure points. Warning icons mark initiatives past recovery thresholds, lock icons indicate escalation required, timeline icons show irreversibility approaching, and termination symbols appear on initiatives where delay eliminates options. Icons never decorate acceptable performance or provide navigation cues.

## 5. How Storytelling Happens Visually

Storytelling flows as cause → consequence → deadline through progressive visual escalation. Current state establishes the cause at the top, cascading consequences build through dependency chains in the middle, and deadline pressure intensifies at the bottom with timeline markers. Each zone advances the narrative from current damage to future irreversibility, creating visual momentum toward decision requirements.

## 6. How Drill-Down Is Signaled

Drill-down is signaled through consequence markers that invite deeper examination of specific failure trajectories, positioned at the end of each escalation chain. These markers indicate deeper evidence exists without suggesting exploration or discovery, appearing only on initiatives requiring intervention or termination decisions.
